# Build
 As of right now, the way only way to use this plugin is by cloning the repo onto your computer, opening the project file with the Projucer, and exporting to your IDE of choice. Then, building it and copying the VST3 file from your Debug/Release folder to where ever you hold your VST3 Plugins.
 
## Plans
- Build a website to display the plugin and its features
- Create and upload binary files to said website for easier downloads
- Refactor codebase and address the remaining bugs
